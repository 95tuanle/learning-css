    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <p>Nguyen Anh Tuan Le is a passionate and highly skilled Software Developer based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
      Currently contributing to the success of KnowQuest.net, I specialize in optimizing backend systems for feedback
      platforms, utilizing my expertise in JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. My focus is on elevating user
      experiences and engagement by refining codebases, improving database structures, and seamlessly integrating
      frontend, backend, and database components. I am actively leading the implementation of AWS Cognito to enhance
      platform security.

      My educational background includes a Postgraduate Certificate of Information Technology Solutions from Humber
      College, where I consistently achieved a place on the Dean's List. I also hold a Bachelor of Information
      Technology from RMIT University, Vietnam, where I honed my skills in web application development using PHP and
      Ruby technologies.

      With a diverse skill set covering Java, Python, Swift, web technologies, databases, version control, and cloud
      platforms, I am committed to developing innovative solutions. Previous roles include Backend Software Developer at
      My Little Tribe Community, where I designed and implemented APIs and databases for a nanny and daycare booking
      system. I successfully managed and deployed backends on Google Cloud Platform, ensuring scalability and high
      performance. My experience also extends to customer service as a Store Associate at TJX Canada – Winners,
      Marshalls, HomeSense.

      I hold certifications in various technologies, including iOS and Android app development, Ruby, JavaScript, and
      aspects of the software development life cycle.

      Consistently recognized for academic achievements, I have received multiple Dean's List honors at Humber College,
      reflecting my dedication to academic excellence.

      In summary, I am a results-driven and innovative Software Developer with a diverse skill set and a commitment to
      excellence. Currently, seeking exciting full-time opportunities, I am open to tackling innovative tech challenges
      that contribute to positive impacts through technology.</p>
